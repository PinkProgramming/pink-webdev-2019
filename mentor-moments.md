# Mentor moments

During the course, each attendee is assigned a mentor who is working as a web developer. During the end of the course (week 8?) the attendees have the opportunity to chat with the mentor about topics and questions they are interested in, for example:

- What do you do at work?
- What salary can one expect as a entry level junior developer?
- How can I find my first project?
- What are topics one could specialize in (BE/FE/UX)?
