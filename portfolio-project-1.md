# Portfolio Project 1: Todo-app
Use create-react-app to build a small todo-application that fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and displays it as a list. 

1. Create a React application using `npx create-react-app my-todo-list`. Add version control (git) to the project. 
2. Remove these files: App.js, App.css, App.test.js, logo.svg and serviceWorker.js. You won't need them in this project.
3. Modify index.js to make it look like a small app with todo-items. The app should show the content of the todo, who wrote it and whether or not it has been completed.
4. Add functionality to mark todos as completed (you don't need to send a request to the JSONplaceholder, but the card should be marked with a checkmark).
5. Add a README-file and push your repo to GitHub.
